Water quality, which is one of the factors limiting access to fresh water the most has been incredible hard to model. We use global satellite imagery datasets to derive proxy indices of surface water quality, and feed those data into our models to make better preditions. However, groundtruthing, needed in order to ensure accurate model calibration, is impossible to do with traditional methods. Smart water sensor aims to fill the data gap. It's a low-cost autonomus sensor that collects basic water quality parameters like pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen and temperature and sends it over LoRa network to remote servers.</p>"},{"location":"blog/","title":"Blog","text":""},{"location":"user-guide/extra-info/","title":"Extra info","text":"<p>Note</p> <p>THis is a note.</p>"},{"location":"user-guide/quick-start/","title":"Quick start","text":"<p>If you just got the sensor set from the SmartWater team, and want to quickly deploy it without getting into the technical nuance of how everything works, this section is for you.

Neverthelsee, it is important to know the stepts in case you need to do it your self. There are two important things to be done regarding gateway configuration before sensor deployment: setting up the internet connection; and configuring the server address to which the gateway is supposed to forward the data. Follow the steps below to set up the gateway with the modem (or a wifi connection point):</p> <p>First thing would be to press the user button (see the sentrius manual for details) for about 5 senconds and then release. The wifi diod will start to blink which means that the gateway created its own wifi network. Connect your computer to that network, just like to any other network. Then go to the local address of the gateway (see the sentrius manual for details).</p> <p>(image 1 Click on the WiFi tab) (image 2 Add new WiFi profile) (image 3 Make sure the wifi profile is activated) (image 4 Go to LoRa settings tab) (image 5 Make sure the UDP forwarder is selected) (image 5 Insert the server address and the port.

Nowadays, deploying a web server is fairly straight forward. You first need to choose your provider. Some of the popular ones are AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean and Linode. Before deployment, you need to decide how big your application can get and choose appropriate infrastructure. Take into account what software stack you want to use (the next section).</p>"},{"location":"user-guide/advanced-setup/self-hosted-deployment/#software_stack","title":"Software stack","text":"<p>When you already have a web server, it's time to install your software stack. In SmartWater project we use an Chirpstack, open-source LoRaWAN network server. Probably the easiest way to set up chirpstack on your server is to use docker and docker-compose. It gives you plenty of room for customization and reproducibility. Check out this guide to learn how to set up chirpstack using docker compose. To customize the installation, you can create your own docker-compose.yaml file.</p> <p>Great. Now you have a platform with a powerful web interface where you can manage gateways, devices and tenants. The next step is to set up data integration. Depending on your goal and what kind of technologies you are familiar with, you have to choose how you would like to permanently store and distribute the data you collect. Chirpstack offers a range of integrations that can work \"out of the box\":</p> Some of the integrations available in chirpstack"}]}
